# SpeechShot
No more print screen, just your voice is all that's needed!
<br />
Run the executable and it'll wait for your input, currently there's two choices:
* 'screenshot' - Take a screenshot, prompts you on where to save
* 'exit' - Exits the program
<br />
Want to collaborate and add more to the program? Feel free!
